Learning objectives and potential project idea

Geoscripting will help to further enhance our knowledge on the use of python and R for solving different environmental issues. 
- With this aim in mind we would love to work on a project to monitor areas with high risk of flooding in Monacco. 
Monacco is one of the top country that is tagged with extreme flooding risk in the world, with the use of geosripting we will be able to predict areas that are highly vulnerable to the risk, such areas will be mapped and different structures will be suggested to help limit or avoid damages in such areas.
We would love to learn more about the following:
1) Geopandas for creating map visualization using R and python. 
2)  How to write code for automation and reproducibility giving the time frame for the project.
3)  How to create an animated map using R and Python.


- Climate and rainfall data for Monacco
-The data we would use for the project is available on the global flood map database.
